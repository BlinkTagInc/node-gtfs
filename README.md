#Node-GTFS

node-GTFS loads transit data in [GTFS format](https://developers.google.com/transit/) from [GTFS Data Exchange](http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/), unzips it and stores it to a MongoDB database and provides some methods to query for agencies, routes, stops and times.  It also has spatial queries to find nearby stops, routes and agencies.

##Configuration for loading data

Before you can use node-GTFS you must specify agencies to download from GTFS Data Exchange. You need the dataexchange_id for each agency you want to include from [GTFS Data Exchange](http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/) - it is in the URL of each individual transit agency's page.

A full list of agencies is available via the [GTFS Data Exchange API](http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/api/agencies).

For example, Austin Capital Metro is `capital-area-transit`, Washington DC is `wmata`.

Add the list of agency keys you'd like to support to config.js as an array called `agencies`

The mongodb URI is also configured in config.js

###To load data

    npm run-script download

To keep schedules up to date, you might want to schedule this to occur once per day.

##Example Application

There is an example web app that creates some restful API endpoints and has a simple frontend for viewing transit data.  It is in examples/express.  You could load the example site with:

    node ./examples/express/index.js
